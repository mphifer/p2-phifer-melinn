					<h2>What is the Venice Urban Forest?</h2>
					<p>
						Over 130 million acres of America’s forests are located right in our cities and towns. Urban forests come in many different shapes and sizes. They include urban parks, street trees, landscaped boulevards, gardens, river and coastal promenades, greenways, river corridors, wetlands, nature preserves, shelter
            belts of trees, and working trees at former industrial sites.
